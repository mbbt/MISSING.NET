The Missing Mobile Client is the Android application for MISSING.NET.

For each disaster the sources need to be changed (as per request of CR this is not user configurable):
 * bump the database version DB_VERSION in MissingDbAdapter.java and
 * adjust the DISASTER in SyncActivity.java


The following libraries are used in the application:

apache-mime4j-0.6.1.jar
httpclient-4.1.1.jar
httpcore-4.1.1.jar
httpmime-4.1.1.jar
osmdroid-android-3.0.1.jar
slf4j-android-1.5.8.jar
